New in version 0.4:
* Introduced freezeout routines (convertfull, preresofull, resofull, 
extractfull) which integrate over the entire transverse plane,
appropriate for arbitrary asymmetric initial conditions. 
* Added option for deformed (but still smooth) initial conditions
to study arbitrary v_n (see FREEZE = -6,-7 or -27 in source and 
arXiv:1007.5469 for explanation)
to compilre properly


New in version 0.3:
* New (optional) blockwise freeze out routine that does not require
monotonically decreasing temperature from the center.
* prereso.cpp to extract spectra before resonance feed down
* ability to choose different forms for the viscous correction
to the freeze out distribution function besides the standard
form quadratic in momentum (see FREEZE parameter in data/params.txt)
* convertfull routine that calculates spectra over all azimuthal
angles, rather than just one quadrant, for unsymmetric initial
conditions (NOT TESTED!)



New in v0.2:

* Bug fixed in calculation of resonances (convert.cpp module)
* Allows for non-vanishing lambda_{1,2} coefficients in the hydro equations
* Allows use of both CGC and Glauber initial conditions (kln module)
* Initial conditions for both RHIC and LHC implemented (initE.cpp module)
* Allows to shut off freeze-out surface finder (isochronous freezeout, see params.txt)

June 21, 2009 (still v0.2):
*changed qcdIEOS.dat file so that values are monotonous
*updated README to give more explanation on physical units
....thanks to Rajeev Bhalerao for pointing out these problems....

July 8, 2009 (still v0.2):
* introduced LCOEF2 in convertnew.cpp so that it would compile
* fixed bug in UVH2+1.cpp and initE.cpp about low-temperature EOS cutoff
  (lowestE); should run now for higher cutoff temperatures EOS than before
